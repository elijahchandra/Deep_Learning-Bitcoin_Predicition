This exercise accomplishes the following tasks:

1. 
Used the deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin closing prices. One model will use the FNG indicators to predict the closing price while the second model will use a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price.

2. 
Created a custom LSTM RNN architecture. One model uses the FNG values and the other is fitted with only closing prices.

3. 
Created models to compare crypto performances.

Conclusion:

Predictions made with closing prices tracks more accurately over time and shows lower losses.
